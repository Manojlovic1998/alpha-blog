# Alpha Blog

This is an example full stack app built using Rails. It is my first project that I have ever built using Rails. The goal is to test out most of the rails functionality including the cli tool and rails console.

The app topic is a simple blog that will envelop CRUD actions and methods.

Things you may want to cover:

- Ruby version

- System dependencies

- Configuration

- Database creation

- Database initialization

- How to run the test suite

- Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

- Deployment instructions

- ...
